# How to build a mobile wallet for Starknet

1. Create a new flutter project

```
flutter create wallet_app
```

Run it locally with `flutter run` to make sure it is properly configured.

2. Create a `contracts` folder and setup a scarb project.

- Install Rust
  ```
  rustup override set stable && rustup update
  ```
- [Install scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/install) and run `scarb --version` to make sure it is working properly
- Run `scarb new contracts` in `wallet_app/`
- Run `scarb build` in `contracts/`

3. Run starknet locally with devnet

- `poetry new devnet`
- `cd devnet`
- `poetry add starknet-devnet`
- `poetry run starknet-devnet`

4. Add `deps`

- `flutter pub add starknet_flutter`
- ```
flutter pub add hooks_riverpod dev:custom_lint dev:riverpod_lint riverpod_annotation dev:build_runner dev:riverpod_generator
```
